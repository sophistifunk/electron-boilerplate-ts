# electron-boilerplate-ts

> Boilerplate to kickstart creating an app with [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) *(formerly atom-shell)* - updated to TypeScript

*See [awesome-electron](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-electron) for more useful Electron resources.*

**Warning:** This is a work-in-progress. It works, but it's not exactly idiomatic TypeScript yet. But it builds :)

## Getting started

`git clone` this repo, then run:

	cd boilerplate
	npm install
	npm start

**TODO:**

 * Better damned documentation for this mutant version
 * Build a couple of base classes for apps, package up some of the more useful electron magic into TS helper classes
